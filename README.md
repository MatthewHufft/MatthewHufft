## Full Stack Software Developer

I'm a fixer. A tinkerer. I can't help but think of better, more efficient ways to do things. In many ways, being a full-stack software developer is less an occupation and more a lifestyle to me. After spending 6 years in the sales and marketing industry, I pivoted to pursue my lifelong passion in software development at Boise Codeworks where I honed my skills in Microsoft .NET, C#, MySQL databases, Vue.js, Mongo, Express, NodeJS, and various frameworks by building out full-scale applications both on and off a team.

I've been fortunate enough to have spent the last 7 years in the sales and marketing industry where I developed myself personally and professionally while gaining experience in direct to consumer, business to consumer, and business to business sales. What I found throughout that time though, was that I consistently kept coming back to coding because it was so fascinating to me. At the beginning of 2020 when everything shutdown for Covid-19, I decided it was time to finally pull the trigger and pursue my passion in software development. I went through the Boise CodeWorks intensive full-stack development course where I spent over 500+ hours building full-scale applications by myself and with teams of other developers. Now that I've graduated I'm looking forward to working on bigger projects and continuing to learn and grow in the field.
