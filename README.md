## Full Stack Software Developer

I'm a fixer. A tinkerer. I can't help but think of better, more efficient ways to do things. In many ways, being a full-stack software developer is less an occupation and more a lifestyle to me. After spending 6 years in the sales and marketing industry, I pivoted to pursue my lifelong passion in software development at Boise Codeworks where I honed my skills in Microsoft .NET, C#, MySQL databases, Vue.js, Mongo, Express, NodeJS, and various frameworks by building out full-scale applications both on and off a team.
